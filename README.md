####GO STUMPY!####

"Go Stumpy! is a fun and exciting 2D platformer where you play as an anthropomorphic tree named Stumpy on a quest to defeat the evil Grand Tree. Traverse through various levels, absorbing enemies to gain their abilities and aid in your quest. But beware! These enemies are determined to end your journey and will stop at nothing to see Stumpy fail. Do you have what it takes to end the Grand Tree's reign of terror and restore peace to the Forest? Or will be bested by the Grand Tree's Jumpies and Speedies?

The mechanics of the game are made to be reminiscent of classic 2D platformers, namely Kirby. The clear inspirations from Kirby shaped much of the core of what makes "Go Stumpy!". However, we made sure to take our own spin on the style, most notably in the design of the characters and the music. The eerie and evil feeling from the enemies creates a sense of real danger in the game and makes the player second-guess their every step. To save from some tension, the music aims to create a sense of homeliness, reminding the player Stumpy is fighting for his home.
